# Wireless Networks and Standards

After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Explain the different wireless network types,
- List the advantages and disadvantages of each wireless network type,
- Describe the wireless networking standards

### Overview of Wireless Networks

- Wireless networks are an alternative to traditional cable and fiber optic networks, enabling mobility by using radio waves for data transmission
- There are several types of wireless networks:
  - WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network),
  - WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network),
  - WMAN (Wireless Metropolitan Area Network),
  - WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network)

These networks follow IEEE wireless standards, which define the protocols for wireless communication

### WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network)

- Range: Around 10 meters (e.g., personal devices like Bluetooth, ZigBee)
- Standard: IEEE 802.15
- Advantages:
  - Flexibility,
  - Efficiency,
  - Easy one-time setup,
  - Portability
- Disadvantages:
  - Limited range,
  - Limited data rates,
  - More expensive

### WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)

- Use: Connects devices within homes, offices, or small businesses using Wi-Fi
- Standard: IEEE 802.11
- Advantages:
  - Reliability,
  - Versatility,
  - High data transmission rates,
  - Easy to manage
- Disadvantages:

  - Low network coverage area,
  - Speed affected by the number of devices,
  - Less secure

- Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax): The latest version of Wi-Fi enables 8K video streaming, cloud computing, and virtual reality experiences using OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access), which makes frequencies more efficient by allowing simultaneous transmissions to multiple devices

### WMAN (Wireless Metropolitan Area Network)

- Range: Greater than 100 meters, used for city-wide or campus-wide networks
- Standard: IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX)
- Advantages:
  - Covers multiple city locations,
  - Easy to use and extend,
  - Managed by an ISP or corporation
- Disadvantages:
  - Requires special permissions,
  - Less secure,
  - Slower than wired networks

### WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network)

- Use: Provides regional, nationwide, or global coverage
- Standard: IEEE 802.20, IEEE 802.22
- Examples: Cellular networks (4G, 5G, LTE) and LoRaWAN (low-power, long-range radio)
- Advantages:
  - Global wireless coverage,
  - Better security than WLAN,
  - Centralized, flexible infrastructure (e.g., cloud apps)
- Disadvantages:
  - Expensive,
  - Difficult to maintain,
  - Decreased coverage over large areas

### WANET (Wireless Ad Hoc Network)

- Use: Instant wireless connections using available infrastructure
- Advantages:
  - Flexible,
  - No required infrastructure,
  - Can be set up instantly
- Disadvantages:

  - Limited bandwidth quality,
  - Not robust,
  - Security risks

- Variations:
  - MANET: Mobile ad hoc networks,
  - VANET: Vehicle ad hoc networks

### Cellular Networks

- Use: Provide regional, nationwide, and global mesh coverage for mobile devices
- Evolution:
  - 2G: Supported digital voice and simple data with 64 Kbps
  - 3G: Mobile broadband with 2 Mbps
  - 4G: 100 Mbps speed
  - 5G: 1 Gbps speed, enabling home internet services
- Advantages:
  - Flexibility, speed, and efficiency
- Disadvantages:
  - Expensive,
  - Decreased coverage in rural areas,
  - Hardware limitations

### Wireless Standards

- IEEE 802.15: Used for WPANs like Bluetooth and ZigBee
- IEEE 802.11: Used for WLANs (Wi-Fi)
- IEEE 802.16: Used for WMANs (WiMAX)
- IEEE 802.20 and IEEE 802.22: Support WWANs and WANETs

- Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax): Supports advanced use cases like 8K streaming and virtual reality with improved efficiency via OFDMA

### Summary

- WPAN: IEEE 802.15, connects nearby personal devices
- WLAN: IEEE 802.11, used for home/office networks
- WMAN: IEEE 802.16, covers city or campus networks
- WWAN: Provides global wireless coverage using IEEE 802.20/22
- WANET: Temporary mobile networks with instant setup
- Wi-Fi 6: Supports high-bandwidth activities with simultaneous transmissions using OFDMA
