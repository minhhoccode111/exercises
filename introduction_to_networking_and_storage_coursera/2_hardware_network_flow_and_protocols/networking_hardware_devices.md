# Networking Hardware Devices

After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Identify common networking hardware devices,
- List differences between similar network devices,
- Explain the significance of each type of network device and its functions

### What are Networking Hardware Devices?

- Networking hardware refers to physical devices that allow communication and interaction on a computer network
- Devices include cables, servers, desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and IoT devices

### Key Networking Devices

1. Server:

   - A powerful computer that stores files and applications for other devices (clients) on the same network
   - Clients access the server to retrieve information or use applications, with the server controlling access levels

2. Node:

   - Any network-connected device that can send or receive information
   - Clients are nodes that access a network through a server

3. Hub:

   - Connects multiple devices in a network and broadcasts data to all devices except the sender
   - Disadvantage: Broadcasts to all devices, leading to inefficiency

4. Switch:

   - Similar to a hub, but maintains a table of MAC addresses to direct data to the intended recipient, making it more efficient
   - Connects to modems and brings down the network if it fails

5. Router:

   - Interconnects different networks or subnetworks, managing traffic between them by forwarding data packets to the correct IP addresses
   - Uses an internal routing table to determine the best path for data packets

6. Modem:

   - Converts data into a format for transmission across a network and converts it back at the receiving end
   - Common types: Cable and DSL modems

7. Bridge:

   - Joins two separate networks, allowing them to function as one
   - Can be wired or wireless

8. Gateway:

   - Allows data to flow between different networks, such as between a home network and the Internet
   - Uses multiple protocols, unlike routers or switches

9. Repeater:

   - Extends a wireless signal by retransmitting it, allowing it to cover longer distances or pass through obstructions

10. Wireless Access Point (WAP):

    - Connects Wi-Fi devices to a wired network and acts as a central wireless connection point
    - Connects to a wired switch and allows devices to access the network and Internet

11. Network Interface Card (NIC):

    - Connects individual devices to a network, either wired or wireless
    - Many modern computers come with built-in wireless NICs

12. Firewall:

    - Monitors and controls network traffic based on security rules, establishing a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external ones (like the Internet)
    - Can be software or hardware based

13. Proxy Server:

    - Acts as an intermediary between a LAN and the Internet, evaluating requests based on preset security requirements
    - Advantages: Hides IP addresses and saves bandwidth by storing data for future use

14. Intrusion Detection System (IDS):

    - Monitors network traffic and alerts administrators of malicious activity

15. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):
    - Inspects network traffic and actively removes or redirects malicious items based on predefined rules

### Summary

- Network devices enable communication and interaction on networks
- Servers store files and applications, nodes and clients access the network, and devices like routers, modems, and switches ensure data reaches its destination
- Security devices like firewalls, proxy servers, IDS, and IPS protect the network from threats
