# Network Types and Topologies

### Network Types and Topologies

After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Define what a computer network is and its purpose,
- Identify the most popular network types,
- List the characteristics of the five main network topologies

### What is a Computer Network?

- Computer networking refers to connected devices like laptops, servers, smartphones, and IoT devices (e.g., security cameras, door locks, doorbells, refrigerators, thermostats)
- Networks enable data transfer and resource sharing, including emails, files, documents, databases, and notifications

### Popular Network Types

1. PAN (Personal Area Network):

   - Allows communication between devices around a person
   - Can be wired or wireless (USB, Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc.)
   - Range: a few centimeters to a few meters
   - Example: Bluetooth connection between a smartphone and an earpiece

2. LAN (Local Area Network):

   - Limited to a small, localized area (e.g., a building)
   - Allows multiple users to share resources (printers, network storage)
   - Requires cables, switches, and routers for connection

3. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):

   - Covers a larger area than LAN, such as a city or campus
   - Formed by connecting multiple LANs
   - Example: City-wide Wi-Fi networks or cable TV systems

4. WAN (Wide Area Network):

   - Extends over a large geographical area, often established via leased telecommunication circuits
   - Used by businesses, schools, and governments to transmit data globally
   - Example: The Internet

5. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network):

   - Connects devices wirelessly in a limited area (e.g., home, office)
   - Users can move freely within the area while maintaining the connection
   - Can also connect to the wider Internet via a gateway

6. VPN (Virtual Private Network):
   - Provides a private and secure connection over public networks
   - Encrypts traffic to protect sensitive data

### What is Network Topology?

- Network topology defines the structure and layout of a network
- Physical topology describes the physical connections
- Logical topology describes how data flows across those connections

### Main Types of Network Topology

1. Star Topology:

   - Devices are connected to a central hub using dedicated cables
   - Most common topology

2. Ring Topology:

   - Devices are connected in a circular pattern, with data flowing in one direction

3. Bus Topology:

   - Devices share a single communication cable
   - Simple and used in small networks

4. Tree Topology:

   - Combines the characteristics of bus and star topologies
   - Devices are connected in a hierarchical manner

5. Mesh Topology:
   - All devices are connected to each other
   - Uses dynamic routing for optimal data flow paths

### Virtual Networks

- Virtual networks are software-based, enabling control over communication across physical networks
- VPN ensures secure data transmission via encryption
- VLAN creates virtual divisions within a larger network for secure collaboration among specific groups

### Summary

- A computer network connects multiple devices to share data and resources
- Network types include PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN, and WLAN
- Network topology defines a network's structure, with key types including star, ring, bus, tree, and mesh
- Virtual networks like VPN and VLAN provide enhanced security and efficiency
