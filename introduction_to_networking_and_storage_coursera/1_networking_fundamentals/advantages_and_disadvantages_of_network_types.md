# Advantages and Disadvantages of Network Types

After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Define the pros and cons of networking,
- Explain how size and connection type affect a network,
- Describe the pros and cons of each network type

### What is Computer Networking?

- Computer networking connects devices like laptops, servers, smartphones, and IoT devices (e.g., security cameras, door locks, and refrigerators)
- Networks provide:
  - Communication tools (email, chat),
  - Sharing of files and devices (printers, security cameras, sensors),
  - Centralized resources (storage, databases, bulk software installation),
  - Remote access to files and tasks,
  - Cost reduction in hardware/software,
  - Security and access control

### Disadvantages of Networking

- Networks require:
  - Technical expertise and maintenance,
  - They are vulnerable to viruses and hacking,
  - More expensive than using a single device,
  - Dependence on other users and systems

### Small vs. Large Networks

- Smaller networks:

  - Easier to troubleshoot, less hardware, easier to secure, upgrade, and manage,
  - Less flexible, fewer resources, lower mobility, but less expensive

- Larger networks:
  - Offer more flexibility and access but require more hardware and are more difficult to manage

### Wired vs. Wireless Networks

- Wired networks:

  - Fixed access points, cheaper hardware, require more devices and cabling,
  - Offer faster connectivity, more security, easier to manage,
  - Less flexible for mobility, harder to set up and scale

- Wireless networks:
  - More flexible and mobile but tend to have higher costs and additional security concerns

### Types of Networks

1. PAN or WPAN (Personal Area Network):

   - Enables communication between devices around a person
   - Technologies:
     - PAN: USB, Firewire,
     - WPAN: Infrared, ZigBee, Bluetooth
   - Range: A few centimeters to a few meters
   - Advantages: Flexible, mobile, portable, easy setup
   - Disadvantages: Limited range and bandwidth

2. LAN or WLAN (Local Area Network):

   - LAN: Group of computers sharing resources through wired connections,
   - WLAN: Uses wireless connections like Wi-Fi
   - Advantages: Reliability, versatility, high data transmission rates, easy to manage
   - Disadvantages: Smaller coverage area, speed affected by the number of devices, security risks

3. MAN or WMAN (Metropolitan Area Network):

   - Optimized for larger areas, often formed by connecting multiple LANs
   - Examples: Cable TV networks, high-speed DSL lines, public Wi-Fi systems
   - Advantages: Covers multiple city locations, easy to use, extend, and exchange
   - Disadvantages: Requires special permissions, higher costs, security risks

4. WAN or WWAN (Wide Area Network):
   - WAN: Provides global coverage (e.g., the Internet, cellular networks)
   - Advantages: Global coverage, more security
   - Disadvantages: Expensive, difficult to maintain

### Summary

- Networks offer control, remote access, and resource sharing but are harder to manage, more vulnerable, and depend on other systems
- Smaller networks cost less and are easier to manage, but have less power and flexibility
- Wired networks are faster, more secure, and easier to manage but require more hardware and offer less flexibility
- Each network type has its own pros and cons depending on size, connection type, and purpose
