# From Wired to Wireless Internet Connections

After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Identify different types of older and newer Internet connections,
- Describe the pros and cons of wired Internet connections,
- Explain how Internet connections have evolved

### Older Internet Connections

- Older types of Internet connections that use phone lines include dial-up, ISDN, and DSL
- Dial-up: Cannot use the phone and Internet simultaneously
- ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network): Transmits data and phone conversations digitally
- DSL (Digital Subscriber Line): Faster than dial-up and can use phone and Internet at the same time

### Newer Internet Connections

- Cable: Uses coaxial cables (like cable TV) and is a common type of connection
- Fiber-optic: Transfers data with light waves instead of electricity; it is the fastest connection
- Satellite: Relies on communication satellites and is common in remote areas
- Cellular: Uses the same channels as cell phones and is also known as WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider)

### Wired Internet Connections

- Wired networking: Refers to using cables or wires for communication between devices in a network
- Dial-up: Requires a modem and phone line to access the Internet

  - Pros: Available to everyone with a phone line and computer, works in remote areas, low cost
  - Cons: Very slow, not suitable for gaming or downloading, can't use the phone at the same time

- DSL: Uses a modem and copper wires in phone lines to transmit data

  - Pros: Faster than dial-up, dedicated connection, inexpensive, can be used with Wi-Fi
  - Cons: Slower than cable and fiber, limited speed, weak over long distances

- Cable: Delivers Internet via copper coaxial TV cables

  - Pros: Uses existing TV infrastructure, fast speeds, more bandwidth than DSL, low latency
  - Cons: Slows down during peak times, upload speeds are slower than download speeds, susceptible to interference

- Fiber Optic: Transmits data using light pulses through glass strands, with speeds up to 200 gigabits per second
  - Pros: Efficient, reliable, great for long distances, fast speeds, ideal for HD streaming and gaming
  - Cons: Expensive, not widely available

### Wireless Internet Connections

- Satellite: Common in remote and rural areas, uses communication satellites
- Cellular: Uses cell phone networks, providing mobility and connectivity anywhere

### Summary

- Older Internet connection types like dial-up, ISDN, and DSL are low-cost with low to medium speeds
- Newer connections like cable, fiber-optic, satellite, and cellular are higher in cost but offer higher speeds and mobility
- Wired connections such as cable and fiber-optic are faster and more reliable, but older technologies like dial-up and DSL are still available
- Wireless technologies like cellular and satellite provide Internet access without wires, especially in remote areas
