# Wireless Connections

After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Understand wireless network types and their differences,
- Identify specific connection examples for each wireless network type,
- List the latest networking trends

### What is a Wireless Network?

- A wireless network allows users to connect without the need for cables
- Wireless networking enables communication and access to applications without physical connections

### Types of Wireless Networks

1. WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network):

   - Interconnects devices in a short range, generally within a personâ€™s reach
   - Examples:
     - Bluetooth: Low-power, short-distance communication between devices like phones and computers
     - RFID: Uses electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling for identification of objects, animals, or people
     - NFC (Near Field Communication): Allows short-range data transfer between compatible devices
     - IrDA: Infrared communication for line-of-sight connectivity between devices

2. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network):

   - Links two or more devices using wireless distribution methods
   - Provides Internet access through access points
   - Examples:
     - Wi-Fi: Wireless signal from a router to devices
     - Standards 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac: Older Wi-Fi standards for WLANs, evolving to faster, more efficient versions
     - Wi-Fi 6 (802.11 ax): Newer standard, offering faster speeds, better battery life, and reduced congestion

3. WMAN (Wireless Metropolitan Area Network):

   - Connects multiple WLANs, generally covering a city
   - Examples:
     - Proprietary Networks: Vendor-specific wireless networks with unique standards and equipment
     - IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX): Standardized version of WiMAX, used for broadband wireless services, especially in rural areas

4. WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network):
   - Covers large areas such as neighboring towns and cities
   - Examples:
     - LTE (Long-Term Evolution): A 4G standard with maximum downlink speeds of up to 150 Mbps
     - LoRaWAN (Long-Range Radio): Balances low power with long-range communication
     - Cellular (4G/5G): Provides Internet access through a network of cell towers connected via satellite

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Wired vs. Wireless Networks

- Wireless Networks:
  - Offer mobility, easy installation, and accessibility from almost anywhere
  - Disadvantages: Higher costs, additional security concerns, slower and less consistent speeds
- Wired Networks:
  - Provide better speed and security, but installation is more difficult and less flexible

### Latest Networking Trends

1. Wi-Fi 6 (802.11 ax): Faster throughput speeds, improved battery life, and less bandwidth congestion
2. Network Analytics: Uses AI and machine learning to provide smarter insights and help manage network disruptions
3. Network Automation: Automates operations to handle the increased demand for network services and ensure continued performance
4. SASE (Secure Access Service Edge): A combined networking and security solution, commonly adopted in cloud, hybrid, or on-premises models

### Summary

- Wireless technologies like Bluetooth and RFID are commonly used in WPANs
- WLANs have evolved with newer standards like Wi-Fi 6, providing better performance
- WWANs, supported by LTE and cellular networks, offer wide coverage for Internet access
- While wireless connections are generally slower than newer wired connections, they offer greater accessibility and ease of installation
- New trends in networking include the advancement of Wi-Fi 6, the use of AI in network analytics, network automation, and SASE for security and networking needs
