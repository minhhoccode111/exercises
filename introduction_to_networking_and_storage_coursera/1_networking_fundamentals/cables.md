# Cables

After watching this video, you will be able to:

- List the most common cable types and their characteristics,
- Understand the purpose of each cable type,
- Identify the most appropriate cable type in various scenarios

### Common Cable Types

- Hard drive cables: SATA, IDE, and SCSI connect the CPU to a deviceâ€™s main storage
- Network cables: Coaxial, fiber optic, and Ethernet connect devices and transmit data
- Serial cables: Used in devices like keyboards and mice, for slow power or data transfer over distances
- Video cables: VGA, HDMI, Mini-HDMI, DisplayPort, and DVI transmit video from devices to displays
- Multipurpose cables: USB, USB-C, Lightning, and Thunderbolt handle fast data and power transfers

### Hard Drive Cables

- SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment): The next-generation hard drive cable, used for high-speed data transmission and connecting to hard drives, optical drives, and SSDs
- IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics): An older 40-wire ribbon cable that connects the motherboard to one or two drives
- SCSI (Small Computer System Interface): Supports up to 16 devices and can use different types of cables (ribbon or standard round cables)

### Multipurpose Cables

- USB cables: Connect a variety of peripheral devices, supporting multiple speeds depending on the version (USB 2.0 to USB 4)
- USB-C: Offers speeds from 480 Mbps up to 40 Gbps, but actual speed depends on the device
- Lightning cables: Proprietary to Apple, used for data and power transmission
- Thunderbolt: Available in copper or optical versions, providing data and power to storage and display devices, with a maximum length of 3 meters (copper) or 60 meters (optical)

### Video Cables

- VGA: Connects older analog video graphics adapters to displays
- HDMI: Common for high-definition multimedia interfaces. Type-A is most used, while Mini-HDMI is Type-C
- DisplayPort: Connects a DisplayPort interface to a display
- DVI: Connects a digital visual interface to a display, with DVID supporting digital signals and DVII supporting both digital and analog signals

### Serial Cables

- Serial cables: Transfer information between devices using the RS-232 standard, typically for devices like modems, keyboards, and mice

### Network Cables

- Coaxial cables: Originally for TV connections, now used for cable TV and Internet, with a 10 Mbps capacity. Common types include RG6, RG59, and F connectors
- Fiber optic cables: Used in WANs, can carry large data volumes over long distances. Types include single-mode (laser-sourced) and multimode (LED-sourced) fibers
- Ethernet cables: Use T568A and T568B standards, consisting of twisted pairs of wires. They are available as shielded (STP) or unshielded (UTP) cables, with higher categories indicating newer, faster cables

### Adapters

- Adapters: Used to connect different cable types, such as DVI to VGA, DVI to HDMI, USB-C to USB-A, and USB to Ethernet

### Summary

- Hard drive cables: Include SATA, IDE, and SCSI, with SATA being the most advanced for high-speed data
- Multipurpose cables: Include universal and proprietary types like USB, USB-C, Lightning, and Thunderbolt
- Video cables: Connect specific video ports to displays, with types like VGA, HDMI, DisplayPort, and DVI
- Serial cables: Follow specific standards and are used in peripheral devices
- Network cables: Include coaxial, fiber optic, and Ethernet, with various connector types such as RJ11 and RJ45
