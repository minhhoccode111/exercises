# Troubleshooting Network Connectivity

Welcome to "Troubleshooting Network Connectivity."
After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Explain the two main symptoms of network connectivity problems.
- List the common causes of network connectivity problems.
- Explain how to resolve common network issues.

## Common Symptoms

- **Can't connect**
- **Slow connection**

### Common Causes

1. **Cable damage**
2. **Equipment malfunction**
3. **Out of range**
4. **Missing network name (SSID)**
5. **Interference**
6. **Weak signal**
7. **DNS/Software malfunction**
8. **Malware**

### Resolving Network Issues

#### 1. Cable Damage

- **Check for physical damage**.
- **Test** with other devices or use a tool.
- **Replace** if damaged.

#### 2. Equipment Malfunction

- **Check network adapter drivers** in Device Manager.
- Ensure **switch port settings** are correct.
- **Replace malfunctioning equipment** if necessary.

#### 3. Out of Range

- **Move closer** to the wireless signal source.
- **Reposition** the source closer to users.
- Use stronger **boosters** or additional devices.

#### 4. Missing SSID

- **Move closer** to the wireless source.
- **Reconfigure** the network to ensure the SSID is visible.
- Use **compatibility mode** for older devices but note it may slow the network.

#### 5. Interference

- **Remove** or relocate the interfering source (e.g., radio, microwave).
- Switch to a **different Wi-Fi frequency** or use **shielded cables** for wired connections.

#### 6. Weak Signal

- **Get closer** to the signal source.
- **Adjust the wireless channel**.
- **Realign devices** and antennas for better reception.
- Ensure **wireless access points** are placed high and centrally.

#### 7. DNS/Software Malfunction

- Run `ipconfig` to check **DNS server configuration**.
- Use the **network troubleshooter** in Windows for apps and OS issues.

#### 8. Malware

- Run **antimalware tools** in Windows Security.
- Adjust **firewall and privacy settings** in Windows, browser, and email apps.

## Conclusion

In this video, you learned that:

- **Can't connect** or **slow connection** are key network problems.
- **Cable damage** or **equipment malfunction** can cause issues.
- Wireless issues arise from **range**, **hidden SSID**, **interference**, or **weak signals**.
- **DNS**, **software configuration**, or **malware** can also disrupt connections.
