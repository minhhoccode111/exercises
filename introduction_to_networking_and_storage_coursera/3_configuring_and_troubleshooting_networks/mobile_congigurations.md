7. Personalize ringtones, sounds, wallpaper, and download/configure apps

### Mobile Device Updates

- **PRI (Product Release Instruction)**: Configuration settings for the device’s network
- **PRL (Preferred Roaming List)**: Tells a device which cell towers to use when roaming
- **Radio Firmware**: Manages connections (cellular, wifi, GPS, Bluetooth, NFC)

## Connection Types

- **Wired Connections**:

  - Mini-USB and Micro-USB (older)
  - **USB-C** (fastest and newest)
  - **Lightning** (Apple-only, equivalent to USB-C)

- **Wireless Connections**:

## Network Connectivity Options

- **Tethering**: Enables a phone’s cell network to provide service to another device
- **Hotspot**: A broadband access point created by tethering
- **Airplane Mode**: Toggles wifi, Bluetooth, and cellular on or off

Users can tether other devices to the internet via hotspot or block connectivity with airplane mode and use Bluetooth for wireless headphones

## Synchronization

- **Cloud Sync**: Collaborate on work documents or take meetings on your phone
- **Desktop Sync**: Access phone photos on your desktop or view PC bookmarks on your phone
- **Vehicle Sync**: Remotely control your car or home appliances
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Use a single ID to log into multiple apps across devices

## Mobile Email Configuration

- **POP3**: Downloads emails and removes them from the server, best for single-device users
- **IMAP4**: Saves emails on the server for access from multiple devices
- Use **SSL** or **S/MIME** to encrypt emails for security and authentication

## Mobile Device Identification

- **IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity)**: A unique number for phones (GSM, UMTS, LTE, iDEN networks). Can be used to block stolen phones
- **IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)**: A unique number for cell network subscribers, usually stored on a SIM card

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)

Using a VPN on mobile devices provides a secure, private connection over public wifi. Supported on iOS, Android, and Windows 10 devices

## Mobile Accessories

- **Headsets**
- **Speakers**
- **Game Pads and Controllers**
