# Network Storage Types

### Key Learning Objectives

- Explain what a SAN does
- Explain what a NAS does
- List the differences between NAS and SAN

### Overview of Network Storage

- **Network Storage**: Digital storage that all users on a network can access
  - **Small Networks**: Might rely on a single device for the storage needs of 1-5 people
  - **Large Networks**: (like the Internet) must rely on hundreds of data centers full of servers

### Storage Area Network (SAN)

- **What is a SAN?**
  - Combines servers, storage systems, switches, software, and services to provide secure and robust data transfers
- **Key Features of SANs**:
  - **Better Application Performance**
  - **Central and Consolidated** storage system
  - **Offsite Data Protection**: Ensures data is protected and ready for recovery
  - **Centralized Management**: Offers simple, centralized management of connections and settings

### Network Attached Storage (NAS)

- **What is a NAS?**
  - A local file server that acts as a hard drive for all devices on a local network
- **Key Features of NAS Devices**:
  - **Convenient Sharing**: Across network devices
  - **Better Performance**: Through RAID configuration
  - **Remote Access**
  - **Works Without Internet**: NAS devices continue to function even when the Internet is down

### Differences Between NAS and SAN

- **NAS**:

  - A connected storage device that is **local** to the network it serves
  - **Attached to a Single Site**
  - **Less Expensive**
  - **Easier to Manage**
  - Appears as a **Network-Attached Drive**
  - Uses **Ethernet** for communication
  - **Does Not Scale**
  - **Single Point of Failure**

- **SAN**:
  - A storage system that involves many devices and connections across **multiple sites**
  - **More Expensive**
  - **Harder to Manage**
  - Appears as a **Local Drive**
  - Uses **Fiber** for communication
  - **Easily Scalable**
  - **Fault Tolerant**

### Summary

- **NAS** is a local device that acts as a file server for all devices on a local network
- **SAN** is a complete networking system that enables efficient and secure storage
- NAS and SAN are different because:
  - **NAS** is local to its network, while
  - **SAN** is a storage system that spans multiple offsite locations and involves many devices, servers, and connections
