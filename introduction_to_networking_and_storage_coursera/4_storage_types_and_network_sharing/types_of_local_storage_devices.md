# Types of Local Storage Devices

Welcome to "Types of Local Storage Devices."  
After watching this video, you will be able to:

- List the differences between RAM and ROM
- Identify the different types of storage drives
- Explain the differences between storage drives

## RAM vs ROM

RAM (Random Access Memory):

- Volatile, cache, or temporary memory
- Fetches data at high speeds
- Stores data for a short time
- Automatically deletes data when the device is turned off
- Used for: Copy/paste, opening programs, background processes

ROM (Read-Only Memory):

- Non-volatile memory
- Fetches data at slower speeds
- Stores larger amounts of data for long-term use
- Keeps data even when the device is turned off
- Used for: Computer booting, process initialization

## Storage Drives

### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

Description: Uses spinning magnetic plates and a read/write head
Key Features:

- Large storage capacity
- Speeds up to 200 MB/s
- Prone to overheating
- Standard for PCs for decades

Best For: Large, archival activities

### Solid-State Drive (SSD)

Description: No moving parts, retains data without power

Key Features:

- Speeds up to 7000 MB/s
- Small, fast, and durable
- Expensive with limited capacity
- Can fail suddenly

Best For: High-speed tasks like browsing or editing large files

### Solid-State Hybrid Drive (SSHD)

Description: Combines SSD speed with HDD capacity
Key Features:

- Faster than HDDs
- Higher capacity than SSDs
- Cost-effective compared to pure SSDs

Best For: Activities requiring both speed and high storage

### Optical Disk Drives (ODD)

Description: Reads and writes data on optical discs like DVDs, CDs, and Blu-rays
Key Features:

- Uses lasers to read/write data
- Known as CD, DVD, BD, or optical drives

Best For: Reading large media files stored on discs

### Flash Drives

Description: Solid-state storage with no moving parts
Key Features:

- Small, fast, and energy-efficient
- Expensive with smaller capacity than HDDs
- Includes USB thumb drives and digital memory cards

Best For: Speed-dependent tasks like browsing and file editing

## Conclusion

In this video, you learned that:

- RAM is for fast, short-term memory, while ROM is for slower, long-term memory
- SSDs are faster and more efficient than HDDs
- Hybrid Drives combine the speed of SSDs with the high capacity of HDDs
- Optical drives read or write data to discs like CDs and Blu-rays
