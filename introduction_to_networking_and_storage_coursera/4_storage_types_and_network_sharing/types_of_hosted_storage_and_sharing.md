# Types of Hosted Storage and Sharing

Welcome to "Types of Hosted Storage and Sharing."  
After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Explain how **Storage as a Service (STaaS)** works
- Describe what a **repository** is and how itâ€™s used
- List the benefits of **Active Directory**

## Storage as a Service (STaaS)

**Storage as a Service (STaaS)** is when companies sell network storage space to customers, removing the need for customers to purchase and maintain network equipment.  
Examples of STaaS include:

- **Dropbox**
- **OneDrive**
- **Google Drive**
- **Box**
- **Amazon Drive**

### STaaS in Action

- **Email storage**: Most email is stored in the cloud, with companies hosting data, emails, and attachments in their data centers
- **Social media storage**: Platforms store user photos, videos, and messages in data centers
  - Example: **Gmail** recovers deleted emails for 30 days, while **Facebook** keeps some user data indefinitely, even after deleting accounts

## Workgroups and Homegroups

- **Workgroup**: A group of computers on a SOHO network without a server. Files and folders are shared publicly, and data is stored on the device that created it
  - Higher risk of data loss due to multiple points of failure
  - **Homegroups** have been removed from Windows 10

## Repositories

A **repository** is a network location where users store, manage, track, collaborate on, and control changes to code

- **Key Feature**: Saves every draft, allowing users to roll back if problems occur, saving time for software developers
- **Examples**:
  - **GitHub**
  - **Docker Hub**

## Active Directory (AD)

**Active Directory (AD)** is a Microsoft technology for managing domain elements such as users and computers

- **Manages**: Domain structure, network access, and external domain connections
- **Remote management**: Can be managed remotely from multiple locations

### Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

AD DS is the core service of Active Directory, offering:

- Centralized data storage and management of communication/search
- User authentication for access to encrypted content
- Single sign-on authentication and encryption-based access control

## Network Drives

**Network drives** are installed on a network and shared with selected users, providing the same services as standard disk drives

- **Location**: Network drives can be local or remote, appearing alongside local drives
- **Installable on**:
  - Computers
  - Servers
  - NAS units
  - Portable devices

## File and Printer Sharing

**File and Printer Sharing** is part of Microsoft Networks, allowing shared file and printer access across a network

- **Network drives**: Accessible alongside local drives or via a web browser
- **Network printers**: Appearing in the printer options popup

## Conclusion

In this video, you learned that:

- **STaaS** allows users to leverage network infrastructure without needing to build and maintain it
- **Repositories** are used by software developers to store and collaborate on code with version control
- **Active Directory** organizes and manages domain and network elements
- **File and Printer Sharing** centralizes resources for users on a network
