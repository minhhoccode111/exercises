### Database Life Cycle Management

Stages of the Database Lifecycle:

- Requirements Analysis
- Design and Plan
- Implementation
- Monitor and Maintain

Requirements Analysis

- Analyze database needs
- Clarify goals and scope
- Identify users and data producers
- Develop data usage samples (reports, dashboards)
- Stakeholders: DBAs, Data Engineers, Developers, Admins, End-Users, Tech Managers

Design and Plan

- Develop database model (ERDs)
- Plan database objects: instances, tables, indexes
- Consider size, capacity, growth
- Plan physical storage and resource allocation

Implementation

- Create database objects: instances, tables, views, indexes
- Configure security: user roles and permissions
- Automate tasks: backups, restores, deployments
- Import/export data, migrate projects between environments

Monitor and Maintain

- Monitor performance, optimize queries
- Review/create custom activity reports
- Apply upgrades, security patches, automate tasks
- Perform user audits, manage access, troubleshoot issues

Summary

- Requirements Analysis: Define purpose, scope, data usage
- Design and Plan: Develop logical/physical design
- Implementation: Deploy and configure database
- Monitor and Maintain: Manage operations, security, performance
