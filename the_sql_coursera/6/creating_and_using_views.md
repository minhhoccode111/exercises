1. What is a View?:

- Definition: A view is a virtual table in SQL, defined by a query but containing no data until queried.
- Purpose: Used to simplify complex queries and enhance security.

2. Why Use Views?:

- Security: Restrict access to sensitive data by exposing only necessary columns.
- Hide Complexity: Simplify complex SQL for less technical users.

3. Example 1: Security Use Case:

- Base Table: `employees` with confidential `salary` data.
- View: Create a view that excludes the `salary` column, allowing non-authorized users to query employee information without accessing sensitive data.

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_basic_info AS
SELECT employeeID, lastname, firstname, hiredate FROM employees;
```

4. Example 2: Simplifying Complex Queries:

- Scenario: A complex three-way join with a group by and order by.
- View Creation:

```sql
CREATE VIEW top_employees_orders AS
SELECT lastname, firstname, TO_CHAR(SUM(unitprice  quantity), '999,999.99') AS total_sales
FROM employees
JOIN orders ON employees.employeeID = orders.employeeID
JOIN orderdetails ON orders.orderID = orderdetails.orderID
GROUP BY lastname, firstname
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

- Result: Users can easily query `SELECT  FROM top_employees_orders` without understanding the complex SQL.

5. Key Points About Views:

- Views are empty until queried.
- Simplifies user access to complex data.
- Enhances data security by controlling what is exposed.

6. Conclusion:

- Views: A powerful tool to manage complexity and security in SQL databases.
