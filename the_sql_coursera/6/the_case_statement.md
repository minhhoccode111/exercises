1. What is the CASE Expression?:

Definition: A SQL construct used to simulate an IF-THEN-ELSE structure.
Purpose: Allows conditional logic within SQL queries.

2. Syntax Overview:

Basic Structure:

```sql
CASE
WHEN condition1 THEN result1
WHEN condition2 THEN result2
...
ELSE default_result
END
```

Key Points:

- Begins with `CASE` and ends with `END`.
- Evaluates conditions sequentially.
- Returns the result of the first true condition; otherwise, returns the `ELSE` result.

3. Example Use Case:

Scenario: Categorize products by price range.
Conditions:

- Price < 20: Economy
- 20 ≤ Price < 80: Standard
- Price ≥ 80: Premium

4. SQL Example:

```sql
SELECT productid, productname, unitprice,
  CASE
    WHEN unitprice < 20 THEN 'Economy'
    WHEN unitprice < 80 THEN 'Standard'
    ELSE 'Premium'
  END AS category
FROM products;
```

Result: The `category` column is populated based on `unitprice`.

5. Practical Application:

Example Output:

- Products are classified as Economy, Standard, or Premium based on their price.

Use Case: Simplifies decision-making logic in SQL queries.

6. Conclusion:

CASE Expression: A powerful tool for implementing conditional logic in SQL.
