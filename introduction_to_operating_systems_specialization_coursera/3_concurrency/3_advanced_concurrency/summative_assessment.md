# Summative Assessment

1. **caches** are small, quick memories that hold copies of data found in the system’s main memory.

Caches are small, quick memories that hold copies of data found in the system’s main memory.

2. Please select which one of the fooling is SQMS.

- single-queue multiprocessor scheduling

The easiest way to design a multiprocessor scheduler is to approach to reuse the basic structure for single processor scheduling by putting all jobs into a single queue, which we call single-queue multiprocessor scheduling, or SQMS

3. How are virtual memory addresses translated using the base & bounds technique?

- virtual address + base = physical address

Each virtual address that is generated by the process is added to the contents of the base register to provide the physical address that can be issued to the system

4. the basic event-based method is immune to concurrency issues?

- True

the basic event-based method is immune to concurrency issues that plague threaded programs

5. Which of the following are necessary hardware support for efficient address translation?(Multiple answers are possible)

- Kernel Mode

- Base and Bounds Registers

- Ability to Raise Exceptions

Out of all of those: I/O Support is not necessary hardware support for address translation
