1. What is a Cartesian Product?:

Result of multiplying every row of one table by every row of another.
Often occurs due to missing or incorrect join conditions.
Produces mostly meaningless data.

2. Why is it Important?:

Common mistake by junior SQL developers.
Leads to incorrect and misleading query results.
Must be avoided for accurate SQL queries.

3. Example Scenario:

Tables: `Employees`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`.
Issue: Joining three tables with only one condition (`EmployeeID`).
Result: Incorrectly inflated numbers due to a Cartesian product.

4. Identifying the Issue:

Use formatting (e.g., commas in large numbers) to spot unrealistic results.
Ensure all relevant tables are properly joined.

5. Best Practices:

Rule of Thumb: For every `N` tables, ensure `N-1` join conditions.
Fully qualify all join conditions to prevent Cartesian products.
Always double-check query results for reasonableness.

6. Correct Approach:

Ensure each table in the join has the correct matching condition.
Example: For three tables (`Employees`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`):

- Join `Employees` to `Orders` on `EmployeeID`.
- Join `Orders` to `OrderDetails` on `OrderID`.

7. Conclusion:

Cartesian products are tricky but avoidable with proper join conditions.
Always verify your SQL joins to avoid misleading data.
