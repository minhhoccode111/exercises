### Introduction to SQL Standards

Evolution Over Time:

- SQL has evolved significantly since its inception, leading to variations across different database management systems (DBMS).
- Each software vendor, such as IBM, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server, customizes their implementation of SQL for their specific DBMS.

### Key Differences Across SQL Implementations

Case Sensitivity:

- Microsoft SQL Server: Case-sensitive (`WHERE NAME = 'Tom'` is different from `WHERE NAME = 'tom'`).
- MySQL/Postgres: Generally case-insensitive, but depends on SQL compiler.

Quotation Marks:

- Microsoft SQL Server: Uses single quotes only.
- MySQL/Postgres: Allows both single and double quotes, but this varies with the SQL compiler.

Aliases:

- Microsoft SQL Server: `SELECT SUM(column_name) = total`.
- MySQL/Postgres: `SELECT SUM(column_name) AS total`.

Commands and Functions:

- LIMIT vs. TOP: `LIMIT` in MySQL/Postgres; `TOP` in Microsoft SQL Server.
- ISNULL Function: Available in Microsoft SQL Server, not in others.

### Importance of SQL Standards

- SQL-92 Standard: Established in 1992, serves as a baseline for most SQL implementations.
- Vendor-Specific Customizations: While learning SQL, be aware that specific syntax and functions may vary across different DBMS.

### Why SQL Standards Matter

- Organizational Impact: Switching DBMS platforms (e.g., from Oracle to MySQL) requires rewriting and retesting SQL code, which can be costly.
- Technologist's Role: As a developer, understanding these differences helps in adapting to the needs of your organization, ensuring you can support transitions smoothly.
