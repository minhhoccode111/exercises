### What is Relational Algebra?

- Foundation of SQL: Relational Algebra is a branch of mathematics that forms the basis of SQL.
- Operations on Sets: Involves operations on sets of data (relations/tables), similar to high school algebra but applied to tables instead of numbers.

### Key Operations in Relational Algebra

- Union: Combines all elements from two tables.
- Intersection: Yields common elements between two tables.
- Difference: Gives elements in one table but not in the other.

### Example Operations

- Projection: Retrieves a subset of columns from a table.
- Selection: Produces a subset of rows based on a specified condition.
- Product: Combines every row of one table with every row of another table.
- Natural Join: Joins two tables on a common attribute (e.g., matching Customer IDs).

### Importance of Relational Algebra

- Historical Context: E. F. Codd developed the relational database model based on Relational Algebra.
- SQL Translation: SQL operations directly implement the concepts of Relational Algebra.
